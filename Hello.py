         Here are some pages that you may enjoy. This project is just a pet project I did hastily on the weekends. 

         There are 2 tabs:
         1. **Extract Text** allows you extract text from various media types: PDFs, websites, youtube, and images
         2. **Marketing Prompts** allows you to take that extracted text and pass it into some pre-written marketing prompts that I wrote that can hopefully help you summarize complex writing into more business friendly terms

         My Twitter account is: 0xDataWolf. Let me know if you have any problems or questions and I'll try to help

         Let's go!
