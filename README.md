# Welcome to Copy Pasta üçù
This is where you can extract text, copy them, and then use it for LLM prompting.
I created this because its much easier to copy text at a go (copy to clipboard) as opposed to manually highlighting with your finger on the phone

Here are some pages that you may enjoy. This project is just a pet project I did hastily on the weekends. 

There are 2 tabs:
  1. **Extract Text** allows you extract text from various media types: PDFs, websites, youtube, and images

  2. **Marketing Prompts** allows you to take that extracted text and pass it into some pre-written marketing prompts that I wrote that can hopefully help you summarize complex writing into more business friendly terms

## Copy Pasta üçù - Streamline Your LLM Prompting

This Streamlit app simplifies the process of copying large amounts of text from various sources (websites, PDFs, images) for easy pasting into LLM prompts, especially on mobile devices. 

### Features:

- **Extract text from:**
    - Website links (including YouTube transcripts)
    - PDF files (with optional OCR for all or specific pages)
    - Images (multiple image uploads supported)
- **Add a prefix paragraph:** 
    - Include instructions or context for your LLM prompt directly within the app.
    - A default prefix for summarization is provided, which you can customize.
- **Copy to clipboard with one click:** Easily transfer the extracted text (with or without the prefix) to your clipboard for pasting into your LLM tool of choice. 

### How to Use:

1. **Choose your input type:** Select "Website Links", "PDF", or "Image (Multiple Allowed)".
2. **Provide the input:**
    - **Website Links:** Paste the URL into the text box.
    - **PDF:** Upload the PDF file. You can choose to OCR all pages or specify a page range.
    - **Image (Multiple Allowed):**  Upload one or more image files. Note that processing time may be longer for multiple images.
3. **Extract the text:** Click the "Extract Text" button. The extracted text will appear in the "Extracted Text" text area. 
4. **(Optional) Add a prefix:** 
    - Check the "Add Prefix Prompt Paragraph" checkbox.
    - Customize the default prefix or write your own instructions in the "Prefix Text" text area.
    - Click "Refresh with Prefix" to see the combined text.
5. **Copy to clipboard:**
    - Click the "Copy Extracted Text" button. The text (with or without the prefix, depending on your selection) will be copied to your clipboard.

### Notes:

- The app requires an internet connection to function.
- Extracting text from images and PDFs can take some time, especially for larger files. Please be patient.
- This app focuses on text extraction and simple prefix addition. It does not directly interact with any LLM. You will need to paste the copied text into your preferred LLM tool.

### Tips:

- Use the prefix feature to give your LLM clear instructions on what to do with the extracted text. For example, you can ask it to summarize the text, identify key themes, or translate it into another language. 
- Be as specific as possible in your prefix instructions to get the best results from your LLM.
